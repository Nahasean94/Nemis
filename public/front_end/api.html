    <h1>DOCUMENTATION FOR THE NEMIS API</h1>
<strong>KEEP CHECKING THIS DOCUMENTATION. NEW ROUTES/APIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADDED WITH TIME</strong>
    <div><p><strong>NOTE: All routes are relative to <code>localhost:3000</code>, which I omit for
        brevity.</strong>
        So for example <code>/search</code> means you include the full path: <code>localhost:3000/search</code> in
        your code/browser.</p></div>

    IT IS REQUIRED OF THE FRONT END DEVELOPER TO OFFER THE 1ST LAYER OF VALIDATION. ALL REQUIRED VALIDATIONS
    ARE INDICATED IN THE SECTIONS BELOW
    <br>
    <strong>We need to deliberate on how to upload certificates of the students to the system</strong>
    <h2> General routes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><code>GET /</code> - sends a request to the server that responds by rendering the home page.
            The
            home page contains among other links, a search form to search the student upi.
        </li>

        <li><p><code>POST /search</code> - sends a request to the server. This should be used as the
            <strong>action</strong>
            value in the form displayed on the homepage. The name of the input field should be <strong>upi</strong>, e.g
            <code>input type="text" name="upi" required placeholder="e.g AA-BB-43"</code>. If a student with that upi
            exists, the server responds with a JSON object with all details of that student. If the student doesn't
            exist, the server responds with an error in the format: <code>${upi} does not match any records</code>. </p>
        </li>

        <li><code>GET /logout</code> -sends a request to the server to destroy a session and redirect the user to the
            home page
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>School admin</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><code>GET /school_admin/login/:upi</code>- the server first checks is the given upi exists, and if it does, fetch the school details. We are interested in the school id which will be used to authenticate the school admin. After this you should display the login form which sends login data to the route below. Use the id as a hidden field in the login form. If no school matches the given upi or some other error, a useful message will be return</li>
        <li><code>POST /school_admin/login</code>- receives a JSON object withe the following properties
        <ul>
            <li><code>username</code>- required type=text</li>
            <li><code>password</code>-required type=password</li>
            <li><code>school_id</code>-required type=hidden. Should be a hidden field whose value is school_id from route above, i.e <code>/school_admin/login/:upi</code>. If successful login, the server returns the id of the school. If unsuccessful, a useful message will be returned.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>GET /school_admin/students</code>- returns an array of JSON objects containing all students of that school</li>
        <li><code>GET /school_admin/teachers</code>- returns an array of JSON objects containing all teachers of that school</li>
        <li><code>GET /school_admin/students/register_student</code> - sends a request to the server which renders the
            form to register a new student.
        </li>
        <li><code>POST /school_admin/students/register_student</code> - when used in a form, you send a json object with
            the following properties :
            <ul>
                <li><code>surname</code>- required, type=text</li>

            </ul>
            The student automatically becomes a student in that school. When saving the details, if successful, the
            server redirects the user to the route <code>/school_admin/students</code>. If not successful in either
            validation or server error, you will get a helpful error message.

            server redirects the user to the route <code>/school_admin/teachers</code>. If not successful in either
            validation or server error, you will get a helpful error message.
        </li>
        <li><code>GET /school_admin/update_school_info</code>- sends a get request to the server which returns a json
            object with all the details of the school if successful, or a helpful error message
